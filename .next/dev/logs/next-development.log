Export BASE_URL doesn't exist in target module

  7 | import Support from "./component/Support";

The export BASE_URL was not found in module [project]/lib/config.ts [app-rsc] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import APP_NAME?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
